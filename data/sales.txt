# STANDARD SHIPYARDS
# Default Navarch Shipyards, featuring a majority of their standard ships.
# Priority 1 (Lowest Priority)
# The Priority system is a quick way for me to gauge where a ship should be placed, starting with the highest priority and working down.
# The process is basically: "Is it experimental? Nope. Is it an outrigger? Nope. Is it a logistical ship? Nope. Is it a missile boat? Nope. Guess it's a standard shipyard entrant then."
# Alternatively, the ship belongs to the first category the answer is "yes" to. For example, even if a ship is an experimental vessel, it immediately gets slotted into the appropriate experimental yard.
