	description "Because their ships are designed to operate both in- and out-of-atmosphere, the Navarchs have a particular distaste towards solar-reliant systems, and ramscoops are no exception. This large device distills fuel over time, allowing a ship to refuel even when solar energy is nonpresent."
	description "	Due to the fact that its size and cooling requirements are on par with a midsized nuclear reactor, it is found only on support ships."

	description "With the claws in their arms acting as electrified harpoons, the Navarchs rarely have a need for artificial weapons; not to mention, they are unlikely to refuse to sell their technology to others, for the right price. However, should someone attempt to capture a Navarch ship by force, this labyrinthine network of choke-points, hidden flanks, automated defenses, and heavy gear for on-board personnel awaits them."
