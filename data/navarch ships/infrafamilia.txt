	description `An "Outrigger" refers both to a secondary hull attached to a ship as well as the ship itself capable of accepting such attachments. The smallest of the Navarchs' outrigger vessels, the Infrafamilia by itself is the smallest, lightest ship in the Navarch fleet, effectively mimicking the role of a Shuttle. Despite this, it is still a full-sized warship, with a decent armament allowing it to tangle with other small vessels and fighters.`
	description `	Outriggers are an aging technology in Navarch space, largely held afloat by pre-existing supply and infrastructure. Though most planetary settlements lack the correct equipment to properly interchange outriggers; instead, loaded variants of the ship must be found aboard space stations, where the interchange infrastructure is much simpler and easier to run.`

	description `With a minelayer outrigger, the Infrafamilia becomes a rather capable patrol boat, able to saturate an area with mines while being able to take more punishment than the Tribus. Additional anti-missile turrets also allow it to more effectively sweep for mines as well, and thus the minelayer outrigger - despite its age - is the most popular configuration of the Infrafamilia.`

	description `This variant of the Infrafamilia has an outrigger designed for long-ranged missile barrages using Ransacker launch systems. Installing the launchers partially below deck cut into the overall outfit space, but the Outrigger provides overall greater weapon capacity, and thus is popular with Navarchs concerned over burst firepower rather than sustainability or maneuverability.`

	description `The introduction of the Forma-class defense fighter meant that even small fighter payloads could be valuable in Navarch fleets, contributing to a fleet's overall defensive power. This configuration of the Infrafamilia allows it to do double duty as both a light warship and carrier, delivering a degree of flexibility not otherwise found on small ships.`

	description `Because outriggers don't have to worry about things like engines or shielding, they can focus entirely on their dedicated purpose. This configuration of the Infrafamilia takes advantage of this fact to massively improve its cargo capacity, while retaining high speed and a large amount of anti-missile to protect its cargo.`
