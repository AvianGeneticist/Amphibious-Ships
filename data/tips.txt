	`This weapon produces too much force upon firing to be safely mounted aboard a standard turret mount, instead requiring a special armored "Barbette" to be installed aboard.`
	
tip "super barbettes needed:"
	`This weapon is too much for a standard barbette to handle; it requires a much rarer "super barbette" to be installed properly.`
