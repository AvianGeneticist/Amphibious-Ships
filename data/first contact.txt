			`You're caught off guard by the size of the spaceport as you come in for landing, having to land on what appears to be a few fighter pads instead of a true ship dock. As you step out, a few of the locals approach you; they're large, eel-like folks, with dark black skin with lighter, pale-green fronts, with long tails ending in large horns. Their clothing looks as though it's intricately woven from individual straps of cloth, formed somewhat tightly to the wearer's body. It accentuates the fact that even the smallest of the locals among you stand a good 2 or 3 feet taller than you, with large builds to match.`
			`	After a few moments of quiet pondering from both you and the alien, it speaks in slightly warbly, but otherwise coherent english. "Well now, you aren't a Quarg, are ya?" They ask.`
			choice
				`	"I am, I just got the small genes in the family."`
					goto short
				`	"I'm a human, why would I be a Quarg?"`
					goto human
				`	"Would me being a Quarg be a problem?"`
					goto problem
					
			label short
			`	The eel alien (and a few of their nearby compatriots) laughs. "No way you're a Quarg; they're too high and mighty to joke about that," They remark, "So, what exactly are ya?"`
			choice
				`	"I'm a human."`
					goto human2
				`	"I'm not one for giving out personal details to aliens; what are you?"`
					goto navarchintro
					
			label human
			`	The eel alien nods. "Well, put simply, the only visitors we get are Quarg coming to make sure we aren't plotting anything 'dangerous', and they only come around so often," They explain.`
			choice
				`	"Why do the Quarg come and visit you?"`
					goto policing
				`	"What are you, anyways?"`
					goto navarchintro
					
			label problem
			`	"Problem's a strong word for it," The eel states, "But the Quarg exiled us a long time ago, and now the only time we get visitors is when they come to make sure we're not doing anything 'in violation of better judgement'."`
			`	A few of the other eels snort and snarl in response to the latter part of the sentence; it seems the Quarg aren't popular around here.`
			choice
				`	"Why do the Quarg visit you?"`
					goto policing
				`	"What are they so concerned about?"`
					goto weapons
					
			label human2
			`	"A human, eh?" The eel leans down a bit to examine you, "Yeah, you fit the bill. The Quarg send snippets through their automata; to try and 'entice us to give up our weapons of mass destruction'," The alien says.`
			choice
				`	"What kind of weapons?"`
					goto weapons
				`	"Automata?"`
					goto automata
					
			label policing
			`	"The Quarg and the Drak they serve don't exactly like our big, fancy explosive teleporters; they say it's 'a danger on a stellar scale', and that 'for peace to reign, they must be destroyed'. So, when we refused to give up our plans, they and the Archons rallied up and forced us to the far reaches of the galaxy," The alien explains.`
			choice
				`	"Well, that's why you're here, but what are you?"`
					goto navarchintro
				`	"Yeah, the Quarg can be a bit of a buzzkill like that."`
					goto insult
				`	"You'd rather be exiled rather than giving up one weapon?"`
					goto valor
					
			label weapons
			`	"Our greatest weapon: The ability to take the explosion that powers a hyper- or scram-drive, and force it back into the physical world, causing an explosion capable of destabilizing a star with enough fuel. The shipboard versions of the weapon don't have nearly enough energy to do that kind of damage, but the Quarg and Drak saw the first prototypes and demanded that we either give them up or get out," The alien says.`
			choice
				`	"Well, that's why you're here, but what are you?"`
					goto navarchintro
				`	"Yeah, the Quarg can be a bit of a buzzkill like that."`
					goto insult
				`	"You'd rather be exiled rather than giving up one weapon?"`
					goto valor
					
			label automata
			`	"Well, we formally declared war on the Quarg," The eel explains, "A war that we never agreed to end. So, we began researching jump drives to return to the Quarg and once again engage them in battle; when they found out, they agreed to give us an adversary to entertain our ideals with."`
			choice
				`	"What kind of ideals require you to go to war?"`
					goto valor
				`	"Yeah, the Quarg can be a bit of a buzzkill like that."`
					goto insult
				`	"Well, that's what you believe in, but what are you?"`
					goto navarchintro
					
			label valor
			`	"In our culture, there is no higher honor than being formally engaged in war, and one tenet of that is that surrender must be mutual in a way that both parties see benefit from," The eel explains, "When the Quarg demanded we either give up our weaponry or leave our home turf, we had an ideological obligation to not surrender our plans, at least without a fair trade; a trade they refused to entertain."`
			`	A few of the other eels contribute stories of how the Quarg demanded all sacrifice and no compensation.`
			choice
				`	"Yeah, the Quarg can be a bit of a buzzkill like that."`
					goto insult
				`	"Well, that's what you believe in, but what are you?"`
					goto navarchintro
					
			label insult
			`	The eel snorts and laughs in response, "Aye, isn't that the truth?" They suppose, chuckling, a few of their compatriots contributing some sort of chant, "You're quite the sight for sore eyes with that sort of outlook."`
			`	"So who are you, exactly?" You ask.`
				goto navarchintro
			
			label navarchintro
			`	The eel smiles, "Ah, we are the Navarchs; masters of the seas and indomitable of spirit," They introduce. "You're welcome to visit our space and purchase our technology, traveller; our time in exile has yielded a vast bounty; one we're willing to share with those of open mind and intentions."`
			choice
				`	"You just... Let strangers buy your technology?"`
					goto buytech
				`	"Is there anything I should know about your space?"`
					goto space
				`	"I hope to be able to see all you have to offer; I think I'll go now."`
					decline
					
			label buytech
			`	"Well, of course. Cultures were not made to exist in solitude and silence; buy our technology, and show it to all; when the time comes for the war of legends, we wish to learn from both our allies and our enemies," The Navarch says.`
			choice
				`	"War of legends?"`
					goto legends
				`	"Is there anything I should know about your space?"`
					goto space
				`	"I hope to be able to see all you have to offer; I think I'll go now."`
					decline
					
			label legends
			`	The Navarch looks on wistfully, "There will come a time when our galaxy will meet a threat beyond any one faction or species; a war where two galaxies' worth of life goes in, and only one galaxy's life survives. When that happens, we want all factions in our galaxy to be ready, not just us."`
			choice
				`	"What a terrifying prophecy. I hope that never comes to pass."`
					goto terrifying
				`	"Should I know anything else before I explore your territory?"`
					goto space
			
			label terrifying
			`	"We can only hope, human. Did you have any other questions for us?" The Navarch asks.`
			choice
				`	"Should I know anything else before I explore your territory?"`
					goto space
				`	"I don't have anymore questions; I think I'll go now."`
					decline
					
			label space
			`	The Navarch thinks for a long moment. "Hmm... Well, you should probably know that our space has occasional pockets of systems that only have one entrance or exit; it can be a problem if you want to get somewhere quickly," The Navarch says.`
			`	The Navarch then perks up, "Ah, you should take some time to map out the wormholes in our space; most of 'em are tucked in dead ends, but they can be mighty handy if you need to slip somewhere quickly; not to mention it saves on fuel," He adds.`
			choice
				`	"Thank you for your advice; I think I'll go now."`

			`As you land on <planet>, you notice a Quarg ship closely following behind you. As you dock, several Quarg exit the ship, and walk towards yours. Nervously, you exit the hatch of your own ship.`
			choice
				`	"Can I help you with something?"`
					goto help
				`	"What's the problem, fellas?"`
				`	(Say nothing.)`
				
			`One of the Quarg speaks up, "We understand that you have, as of recent, unlocked the wormhole gating the Navarchs from the rest of the galaxy," The Quarg says.`
			choice
				`	"I did? Ma just raised me to push buttons when I see them."`
					goto innocent
				`	"That's correct, is that a problem?"`
					goto problem
					
			label help
			`"As a matter of fact, you can," The Quarg states, "Recently, you've been recorded unlocking the wormhole to the Navarchs and contacting them; is this true?" They ask.`
			choice
				`	"I did, is that a problem?"`
					goto problem
				`	"Oh, so that's what the buttons did."`
					goto dumbfounded
					
			label innocent
			`The Quarg stare at you for a long moment, clearly not buying that you did all of this "coincidentally". The Quarg in front sighs, "Well, regardless of your intent, please observe their culture with caution, rather than a desire to replicate it."`
			choice
				`	"They seemed fairly relaxed, to me. They just like big guns."`
					goto chill
				`	"They said you exiled them to the fringes."`
					goto exile
					
			label dumbfounded
			`The Quarg all stare at you for a long moment, as if deciding questioning you further is worth their time. Eventually, one of the Quarg sighs, "To put it simply, please do not seek to replicate their warlike, militarized ways. They are exiled for a reason," The Quarg insists.`
			choice
				`	"They seemed fairly relaxed, to me. They just like big guns."`
					goto chill
				`	"They said you exiled them to the fringes."`
					goto exile
					
			label problem
			`The Quarg share a brief glance among one another. "Well, you returned in one piece without a full Navarch invasion fleet, so it's hard to say so. Please, however, observe their warlike tendencies as a cautionary interest, rather than a lifestyle to be emulated," The Quarg requests.`
			choice
				`	"They seemed fairly chill, to me. They just like big guns."`
					goto chill
				`	"They said you exiled them to the fringes."`
					goto exile
					
			label chill
			`The Quarg gives you a curious glance. "Hm. Perhaps the eyes of a young race see it differently than we do after thousands of years of war across the galaxy," They suppose, chattering among themselves for a moment, before abruptly beginning to leave, one saying "Thank you for your time," As they all plod off.`
				decline
			
			label exile
			`The Quarg sighs, "It was a necessary evil. A faction as large and powerful as the Navarchs are a danger to the galaxy; they were headed toward a future similar to many species who seek only to improve their war technology," The Quarg states.`
			`	Another Quarg chimes in, "The weapons they developed were not simple nuclear weapons or large-scale lasers. The ability to project an explosion anywhere in relatively near space is the sort of technology that can end entire stars," They detail.`
			choice
				`	"To me, it sounds like you exiled them out of fear of their strength."`
					goto fear
				`	"You've never considered just asking them to not scale it past a certain size?"`
					goto ask
				`	"I'll be sure not to provoke any more military development. I'll be going now."`
					decline
					
			label fear
			`The Quarg's skin visibly lights up for a moment with vibrant red and blue hues, before one eventually says, "Perhaps, in some small way, you are right," They admit, "But our decision is final."`
			`	The Quarg rather quickly leave after this, leaving you to contemplate their warnings.`
				decline
				
			label ask
			`The Quarg share a curious glance, before turning back to you. "Our policy against their weapons has been very 'ground-zero', as a human might say it. Diplomacy has never been an option with such powerful weapons in play," They admit.`
			choice
				`	"The Navarchs told me their belief is that surrender is only acceptable with compromise from both sides."`
					goto policy
				`	"It sounds to me like you took the nuclear option too soon."`
					goto toosoon
				`	"I suppose that's understandable. I'll stop wasting your time now."`
					decline
					
			label policy
			`The Quarg think for a moment, but quickly shake their heads, "Negotiation with our technology is not an option; our technology is too powerful, even for a faction that rivals our own strength," The Quarg says, "Now, that's enough. You may go now, human," They state. Their tone is suddenly a bit hurried, as if they're considering what you said more than they let on, but they hustle away too quickly to follow up on the matter.`
				decline
			
			label toosoon
			`The Quarg share a short glance, then turn back to you. "An interesting opinion, but one we nor the Drak agree with," The Quarg says, "You may be on your way, now. Thank you for your time," They say, beginning to hustle back to their ship.`
