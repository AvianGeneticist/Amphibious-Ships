	description "Lathe Mines are a particularly brutal type of obstacle that the Navarchs designed to be laid out in great numbers, dealing crushing damage to any ship who dares to stumble into them. Using similar technology to the phase torpedo, Lathe Mines cause heavy damage even through shields."
	description "The unique design of the Lathe mines means that, though they're intended as a trap, they are capable of serving as a form of anti-area projectile in the right conditions."

	description `True to its name, this weapon works in a similar method to a commonplace hyperdrive; it uses a large quantity of deuterium to produce a large explosion. However, instead of tucking it into a safe region of spacetime to accelerate the ship, the device warps the explosion a good distance in front of the firing ship, causing a devastating explosion. According to Navarch legend, this was the weapon that caused the Drak and Quarg to seal the Navarchs away.`
	description `	Somehow, the Navarchs have found a way to program the explosion in a way that it doesn't harm allied ships, meaning that, for a weapon of mass destruction, it's surprisingly safe to use.`

	description `The earliest phases of this weapon's development harken back to before the Navarchs even first came into contact with the Quarg; an early attempt at using energy to replace the fuel in a Hyperdrive's operation, allowing a planet to theoretically launch fighters without any need for deuterium or worry of fallout from the fusion explosion that powers a Hyperdrive. The device failed, and was shelved for millenia.`
	description `	Relatively recently, however, some attention was brought back to the device, with the hopes that it could be turned into an effective weapon against swarms of Quarg Automata. The resultant weapon fires enormous yottrite-alloy slugs at near-light speed, causing an explosive effect on target and effortlessly cutting through all in its way.`
	description `	(Note: The amount of contact per shot can vary with enemy size, so damage per second is approximate.)`
