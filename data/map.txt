	description "This is one of the few worlds with enough notable landmass for the Navarchs to have built landbound ship facilities. Besides that, it is also a super-ocean world, with a surface area nearly 6 times larger than Earth, nearly 98% of which is water. As such, it serves as the perfect staging ground for the Navarchs' massive warfleets."
	spaceport "The spaceport sprawls all over and around a lone continent around the size of south america; large ships wait at port around the coast, with several channels reserved for ships coming in for landing. Each dock here could hold 5-6 human ships of any size."

	spaceport `The spaceport here is entirely seabound, with large "runways" for ships to land on the water. As expected, the scope is truly massive; each dock here is roughly six times the size of the largest human space docks.`

	description "Easibe is a very warm, prosperous ocean world, with large stakes in the industries of both farming and deep-sea drilling for oil."

planet Laptev
	landscape land/sea5
	description "Laptev is a temperate and calm, but otherwise boreing ocean world; it is valued by the Navarchs only as a staging point for military fleets."
	spaceport "The spaceport here is almost comparable to a rural human spaceport, despite the size of the individual docks; parked vessels awaiting launches for patrols are a frequent sight, drifting idly through the mist."
	
planet Pechora
	landscape land/snow5
	description "Pechora is an ice world, but plays home to some crucial material refineries; as such, large channels of water have been carved out of the multiple-kilomter-thick ice sheets that evenly obscure the true surface of the planet, with small ships patrolling and using small heat rays to ensure the channels don't refreeze."
	spaceport "The spaceport on Pechora is highly organized and automated; even the Navarchs' largest cargo ships are very swiftly loaded with kilotons of refined metals for export."

planet Beaufort

	description "Beaufort is an artificial planet made from aeons of accumulated metal slag painstakingly melted together using its parent star's residual heat, before being poulated with large water channels to accomodate a limited Navarch presence here. Beaufort's value comes from the presence of yottrite in its home system, which the Navarchs use in their ships and weapons."
	spaceport "Beaufort's spaceport seems to have been formed of molten metal slag like much of the rest of its surface, with natural outcrops serving as docking bays. Though the planet's surface is surprisingly temperate and has enough gravity to hold the water channels in place, it has no noticeable atmosphere."

planet Fochexa
	landscape land/sea8
	description "Fochexa is a warm ocean world with high, sharp spires of rock that stretch from the ocean floor to the surface, forming small islands anywhere from a few feet to a mile across. These landmasses arne't large enough to establish any sort of presence on, but they do lend the Navarchs a helping hand when it comes to monitoring the drifting of the spaceport."
	spaceport "The spaceport is a sprawling complex of docks and channels, serving many military fleets as they pass through here. This planet serves as a critical chokepoint, and as such, is heavily guarded."
