planet Gulfosala
	landscape land/beach1
	description "This is one of the few worlds with enough notable landmass for the Navarchs to have built landbound ship facilities. Besides that, it is also a super-ocean world, with a surface area nearly 6 times larger than Earth, nearly 98% of which is water. As such, it serves as the perfect staging ground for the Navarchs' massive warfleets."
	spaceport "The spaceport sprawls all over and around a lone continent around the size of south america; large ships wait at port around the coast, with several channels reserved for ships coming in for landing. Each dock here could hold 5-6 human ships of any size."

planet Chukchi
	landscape land/sea3
	description "Chukchi was originally a military outpost, but has since been rebranded a large-scale fishing colony due to the presence of many species of hyper-productive fish; this one planet alone is capable of sustaining the food needs of nearly a fifth of the Navarchs' population."
	spaceport `The spaceport here is entirely seabound, with large "runways" for ships to land on the water. As expected, the scope is truly massive; each dock here is roughly six times the size of the largest human space docks.`
