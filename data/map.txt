	description "This is one of the few worlds with enough notable landmass for the Navarchs to have built landbound ship facilities. Besides that, it is also a super-ocean world, with a surface area nearly 6 times larger than Earth, nearly 98% of which is water. As such, it serves as the perfect staging ground for the Navarchs' massive warfleets."
	spaceport "The spaceport sprawls all over and around a lone continent around the size of south america; large ships wait at port around the coast, with several channels reserved for ships coming in for landing. Each dock here could hold 5-6 human ships of any size."
